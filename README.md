# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## E2E Tests

This project uses [Maestro](https://maestro.mobile.dev) for end-to-end testing on Android.

The debug APK is a development build (`expo-dev-client`) and **needs the Metro bundler running** to serve the JS bundle.

```bash
# Install Maestro CLI
curl -fsSL "https://get.maestro.mobile.dev" | bash

# Terminal 1: ensure EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL is set, then start Metro
export EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
pnpm start

# Terminal 2: build, install, and run tests
pnpm run build:android:local
adb install android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
pnpm run test:e2e
```

See [e2e/README.md](./e2e/README.md) for detailed setup and CI workflow reference.
